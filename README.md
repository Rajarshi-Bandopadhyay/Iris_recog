# Iris_recog
Iris detection project for AE663

This is an Iris Detection project for the subject AE663 in our college.

Pre-requisites for this toolbox:
-------------------------------

1. Python 3.5 or compatible.
2. Scikit-Image, available with the following shell command:
	-- Linux and MacOS users: pip install -U scikit-image
	-- Windows: instructions are available at "http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scikit-image"
3. OpenCV, of which a specific version has been used.(this will be changed in future upgrades)
	-- Ubuntu users can run the Makefile and obtain the relevant software. The download will take several hours and a lot of disk space.
	-- Other OS implementations have not been done yet, but we are planning to scrap the use of PIL and OpenCV, and replace both by Scikit-Image only.
